forecasting,1,electricity,Electricity,The `Electricity` dataset represents the electricity consumption of 370 clients recorded in 15-minutes periods in Kilowatt (kW) from 2011 to 2014. This is an aggregated version of the original dataset used by Lai et al. (2017). It contains 321 hourly time series from 2012 to 2014.,HOURLY,1,0,utf-8,720
forecasting,2,etth1,ETTh1,"The Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) dataset is a crucial resource for studying the long-term deployment of electric power infrastructure. It contains data collected over two years from two regions of a province of China. This variant called ETTh1 represents data from one of these regions at an hourly granularity. Each data point includes the target value `oil temperature` and six power load features. For the purpose of univariate time series analysis, the original dataset, which contains a single series with 7 features, has been converted into 7 separate univariate series. This dataset is particularly valuable for analyzing temperature variations and trends on an hourly basis, facilitating the development of models that can predict short-term temperature changes. Make note that another subset, named ETTh2, contains similar data from the second county's transformer.",HOURLY,1,0,utf-8,720
forecasting,3,etth2,ETTh2,"The Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) dataset is a crucial resource for studying the long-term deployment of electric power infrastructure. It contains data collected over two years from two regions of a province of China. This specific variant, ETTh2, represents data collected over two years from the second of the two regions in China, aggregated at an hourly granularity. Each data point comprises the target value `oil temperature` and six power load features. For the purpose of univariate time series analysis, the original dataset, which contains a single series with 7 features, has been converted into 7 separate univariate series. This dataset is particularly useful for studying temperature variations and trends on an hourly basis, providing insights that are essential for developing models to predict short-term temperature changes. Note that there is another dataset, ETTh1, derived from the same source, covering a different region.",HOURLY,1,0,utf-8,720
forecasting,4,ettm1,ETTm1,"The Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) dataset is a crucial resource for studying the long-term deployment of electric power infrastructure. It contains data collected over two years from two regions of a province in China. This variant, called ETTm1, represents data from one of these two regions at a 15-minute granularity. Each data point includes the target value `oil temperature` and six power load features. For the purpose of univariate time series analysis, the original dataset, which contains a single series with 7 features, has been converted into 7 separate univariate series.

forecasting,6,traffic,Traffic,This dataset contains the San Francisco Traffic dataset used by Lai et al. (2017). It contains 862 hourly time series showing the road occupancy rates on the San Francisco Bay area freeways from 2015 to 2016.,HOURLY,1,0,utf-8,720
forecasting,7,weather,Weather,"This is the `Weather` dataset sourced from the Max-Planck-Institut. It contains weather observations recorded every 10 minutes for the 2020 whole year, containing 21 meteorological indicators, such as air temperature, humidity, etc. The original dataset can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tc7GeVN7DLEl-RAs-JVwG9yFMf--S8dy/view?usp=share_link. For the purpose of univariate time series analysis, the original dataset, which contains a single series with 21 features, has been converted into 21 separate univariate series.",OTHER,0,0,utf-8,4320
